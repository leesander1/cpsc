    "### 2.1 Mac/Linux Users\n",
    "- **Download Anaconda**:\n",
    "  - Visit the [Anaconda download](https://www.anaconda.com/download) page and download the installer for your OS.\n",
    "- **Install Anaconda**:\n",
    "  - Follow the instructions on the download page to run the installer.\n",
    "- **Test Jupyter Notebook**:\n",
    "  - Open a Terminal window and type:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    jupyter notebook\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - Alternatively, use the Anaconda Launcher to start Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "  - A new browser window should open.\n",
    "  - Click **New Notebook** and give it a unique name.\n",
    "- **Working in a Specific Folder**:\n",
    "  - Open a terminal and navigate to the desired folder using:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    cd Documents/cpsc4300\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - Start Jupyter Notebook in that folder:\n",

    "### 2.2 Windows Users\n",
    "- **Download Anaconda**:\n",
    "  - Visit [Anaconda download](https://www.anaconda.com/download) page.\n",
    "  - Download the correct version for Windows.\n",
    "- **Install Anaconda**:\n",
    "  - Follow the instructions provided during the installation. Typically, Anaconda will be installed in `C:\\Anaconda`.\n",
    "- **Test Jupyter Notebook**:\n",
    "  - Start the Anaconda launcher from the installation directory or the Start menu.\n",
    "  - Launch Jupyter Notebook, and a new browser window should open.\n",
    "  - Create a new notebook with a unique name and search for the file in Explorer to find the default folder location.\n",
    "       - **Trick**: give this notebook a unique name, like `my-little-rose`. Use Explorer (usually start menu on windows desktops) to search for this name. In this way, you will know which folder your notebook opens in by default.\n",

    "  - If Anaconda was not added to your path, use the full path to Python, such as `/anaconda/bin/python`.\n",
    "- **Update Anaconda**:\n",
    "  - If you have installed Anaconda previously, update to the latest version:\n",

    "If I could summarize their differences into a sentence it would be that\n",
